# Face_Recognizer
The Face Recognition project is a computer vision application built with Python and OpenCV. It uses deep learning algorithms to detect and recognize faces in real-time video streams or still images. The project involves training the deep learning models on a dataset of face images and then using these models to detect and recognize faces in new images or videos. The system can be used for a variety of applications, including security systems, automated attendance systems, and personalized experiences in digital devices. The project also involves using image processing techniques to enhance the quality of images before recognition.
